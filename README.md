The VSCP helper library is a collection of library tools for VSCP program development. This library includes most of the stuff that is needed by a programmer to interface Level I drivers \(previously called CANAL drivers\) and the talk to a VSCP daemon \(Level II\) remotely over TCP/IP as well as a lot of other things. All helper functionality and all communication functionality is included in the library.

You can either use the library in binary form as a set of C exported functions expoorted by a dynamically loaded lbrary or by including a number of C++ classes in your project.

The library is currently available for Unix/Linux and for Windows.

The library is licensense: under [the  MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
