The VSCP helper library is a collection of library tools for VSCP program development. This library includes most of the stuff that is needed by a programmer to interface Level I drivers (previously called CANAL drivers) and the talk to a local or remote VSCP daemon (Level II) over TCP/IP and a lot of other things. All helper functionality and all communication functionality is included in the library.

You can either use the library in binary form as a set of C exported functions exported by a dynamically loaded library or by including a number of C++ classes in your project.

The library is currently available for Unix/Linux and for Windows. It should be posible to port to Mac and other systems.

The library is licensense: under [the  MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) so it can be used freely in opne and closed project.
