# Abstract

VSCP helper library is a collection of library tools for VSCP program development. This library includes most of the stuff that is needed by a programmer to interface Level I drivers (previously called CANAL drivers) and the talk to a VSCP daemon (Level II) remotely over TCP/IP as well as a lot of other things. All helper functionality and all communication functionality is included in the library. Also ready to work with threads for receiving and transmitting events.

The library is currently available for Unix/Linux and for Windows.
